we "improved" by:

- using templates
    in class vcs_utility for function difference
    for split function in DGrpah
    for split function stage_file_entry

- operator overloading
To check if to stage file entries are the same we had some id and a function to
compare them.
Now we added the functions
        bool operator==(const StagedFileEntry &other) const;
        bool operator==(const std::experimental::filesystem::path &path) const;
to make comparisions


For the graph we had a function print_to which we replaced with the function
        friend std::ostream &operator<<(std::ostream &os, const DGraph &m);

- proper variable declaration
 for example
    -"unsigned" instead of always using "int"
    - constexpr if possible

- decltype keyword
In the function StageFileEntry::getTimeStamp we had to use the declaration for
the time which we now replaced with
the function decltype()

We all agree that our programming skills have improved, some more some less,
depending on the skills we've already had.
