# Exercise Sheet 10 -- Even More Meta

*due on 19 January 2018*

## Task 1

Revisit the `has_print_to` meta function from the lecture.

Build a new meta function `is_printable` which returns *true* iff the given type has a `print_to` function taking a `std::ostream&`,
or can be printed via an output stream operator.

Provide a few examples (positive and negative) to show that your implementation works.

## Task 2

Investigate the impact of meta programming regarding compile time.
Provide a handful of examples for illustration.

What ways are there to mitigate the impact on compile times.

## Task 3

Revisit the roadmap you submitted previously for your dungeon crawler project.
Sort your remaining tasks by priority and fulfil as many as possible, starting with the highest priority, until next week.

## Evaluation

Next time you'll have the (perhaps) one-in-a-life-time chance to evaluate me.
The usual evaluation form is used, which allows me to state up to 4 custom questions, which are:

1. I prefer having the course material on GitHub to having it on OLAT.
2. I enjoyed working on the dungeon crawler project.
3. I am interested in game development and related topics.
4. I'd like to have a written test at the end of the pro seminar.

After that you have the option to state improvements for this course.
Please think about improvements beforehand and do not leave this section empty.
For me this is the most important part of the whole form.

> Though almost nothing is certain in the main game, the Ashes of Ariandel reveals that Sulyvahn was born in the Painted World of Ariandel.
> Despite being born and raised inside the painting, he had not yet experienced loss or despair as most residents of the painting do, which results in them being drawn into it.
> As such, he had no meaningful connection to it and he left the painting behind, even forsaking the frost sorceries that his painted worlds had pioneered.

> At one point, the young frost sorcerer found the Profaned Capital below a tundra some distance from Irithyll, and the Profaned Flame with it.
> Taking the Profaned Greatsword along with his ambition, he set out to control Irithyll.
> He eventually accomplished his goal and used his Pontiff Knights to maintain control in Irithyll while the Outrider Knights were sent to conquer faraway lands.
> To make sure the outrider knights never betrayed the Pontiff or opposed him, they were bestowed with certain rings that, unbeknownst to them, would eventually drive them mad with visions of endless combat and turn them in to beasts.
> For this reason, outrider knights were seen as exiles.
> Notable members among the Outrider Knights were Vordt and a distant daughter of the Irithyll royal family who were both sent to conquer Lothric.
