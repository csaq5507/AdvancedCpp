The game does not have any goal yet. For this an additional game mechanism is needed
-> For example adding a highscore would give the game a goal.
Another mechanism would be an inventory for weapons and a additional view which shows the
life points etc

At the moment the game is nice to play but without any goal it becomes boring at some
point.
The above described points would make the game more interesting. Also changing the graphical
interface (background, walls, aniamations) would increase the fun factor.

Future tasks:
- Change graphic layout (1 task for a week)
- Inventory (1 task for a week)
- Adding additional informations view (1 task for a week)
