#### Already Refactored ###

- The speed of each entity was a bit messy so we had to refactore it. each 
  entity had his own clock to wait between the update/walk function call, now 
  this is unified in the entyty class

-   The move function initially took the distance to move and the direction, 
  after the refactoring every entity got a direction so the move function only
  needs a distance now. Some visual bugs with the sprites got fixed by this.

- Weapons got their own class with some attributes, initialli there was a weapon 
  enum with 3 elements and every function regarding to weapons contained a 
  switch(weapon){ case Weapon::flint....

- the player input(event handler) was a mess and got refactored.. watch(diff 16: 
  https://github.com/csaq5507/AdvancedCpp/commit/3b08a6b394153b81467cbd2625d133c1b1dbd90d#diff-16)

- a lot of small refactor steps.



#### Additional refactor steps(to do) ####

- the event handler probaly needs more refactoring(if user inputs increases)
