template
    in class vcs_utility for function difference
    for split function in DGrpah
    for split function stage_file_entry


To check if to stage file entries are the same we had some id and a function to compare them.
Now we added the functions
        bool operator==(const StagedFileEntry &other) const;
        bool operator==(const std::experimental::filesystem::path &path) const;
to make comparisions


For the graph we had a function print_to which we replaced with the function
        friend std::ostream &operator<<(std::ostream &os, const DGraph &m);


In the DGraph we made the variable delimiter a constexpr

In the function StageFileEntry::getTimeStamp we had to use the declaration for the time which we now replaced with
the function decltype()
